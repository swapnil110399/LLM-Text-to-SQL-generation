# LLM-Text-to-SQL-generation

This project demonstrates a natural language processing (NLP) system that converts text-based user queries into structured SQL queries to retrieve relevant data from BigQuery tables. The system leverages several key components including Vertex AI, Code Bison, and LangChain to process the input query, detect intent, recognize entities, map the intent to a database schema, construct the SQL query, execute it, and finally transform the response into a user-friendly format.
